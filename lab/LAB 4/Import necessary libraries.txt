Import necessary libraries 

Read the Google stock price data using pandas 

Preview the data using head command 

Set the date column as index

Keep only date and close price column for further analysis, and drop the remaining column

Plot the closing price visually inspect whether the data is stationary or not
Split the data in 3 parts and calculate the mean and variance of each part and check if that satisfies the stationary condition

Calculate the rolling mean and plot the graph 

You may apply any three differencing methods to make that data stationary and also plot each graph to see the before and after difference 

and also apply ADF and KPSS method to check and prove if that data has become stationary or not after each differencing methods.

Rest follow the same to implement AR model as given in reference shared python code.
